What went well with this assignment?
The testing part went smooth because I set the timing clock correct. 
The coding is also working well. I was kinda confused at first but then went back to the slides talked in the class and asked some help from classmates. 

What was difficult?
Not really. 

How would you approach differently?
Start early than the last minutes. 

Anything else you want me to know?
N/A
